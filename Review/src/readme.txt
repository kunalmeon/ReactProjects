We can use font awesome icons for that we have to install react-icons package using npm i react-icons
and then we have to import the icon which we want to use to do so we 
import { FaChevronLeft, FaChevronRight, FaQuoteRight ,FaAmazon} from 'react-icons/fa';

Now finally we can use that icon inside our app. Note we have to make component for the icon like
<FaAmazon/>
